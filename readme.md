# reviewCarousel

This project will give you more practice working with the DOM and you can use this simple counter in other projects like a pomodoro clock.

By manipulating the DOM, you have infinite possibilities. You can create applications that update the data of the page without needing a refresh. Also, you can create applications that are customizable by the user and then change the layout of the page without a refresh.

## Key concepts covered:

* document.querySelectorAll()
* forEach()
* addEventListener()
* currentTarget property
* classList
* textContent
